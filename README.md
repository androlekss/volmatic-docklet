## Features
A volume control docklet for Plank Reloaded using wpctl for managing PulseAudio/PipeWire sinks.
- Left-click or hover shows a tooltip popup with current volume.
- Scroll the mouse wheel over the icon to adjust the volume in real time.
- Dynamic icon changes depending on the volume level: muted, low, medium, high.
- Works with PulseAudio and PipeWire using wpctl.

## Dependencies

- vala
- gtk+-3.0
- plank-reloaded
- glib-2.0
- gee-0.8
- wpctl (for volume control)

## Installation

### Method 1: Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/androlekss/volmatic-docklet.git
cd quit

# Build and install
meson setup --prefix=/usr build
meson compile -C build
sudo meson install -C build
```
## Setup

After installation, open the Plank Reloaded settings, navigate to "Docklets", and drag and drop Volmatic onto your dock.

## Usage

- Hover over the docklet icon to show the volume popup.
- Scroll the mouse wheel over the icon to increase or decrease volume.
- The icon automatically updates to reflect the volume level:
- üîá Muted

‚ÄúScroll to adjust volume‚Äù

## Optional: Show current media information

If you'd like VolMatic to display the current track and artist (media info), you need to:
Install playerctl, a command-line utility that interacts with MPRIS-compatible media players:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install playerctl

# Fedora
sudo dnf install playerctl

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S playerctl
```
##  Enable the corresponding setting in VolMatic preferences (e.g. Show media info).

Playerctl works with most MPRIS-compatible players, including:
- Spotify
- VLC
- Chrome / Firefox (media tabs)
- Rhythmbox
  and many others
  If playerctl is not installed or no compatible player is running, media info will not be shown.
